    <h2>Attack phase</h2>
    <p>
      In this phase you can move and attack with your cards in play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cards cannot move the same turn as they are played but they can attack other cards in the same zone.
      Your spaceships cannot attack the enemy station cards the first turn they moved to the enemy zone. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cards may have special attacks, or certain properties described on the
      card itself. You can right click or long press on any card to examine it.
