      You can now move and attack with your cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cards can not move at the same turn as they are played. Later when you do
      move them, you cannot attack your opponents station card on the same turn
      they moved there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cards may have special attacks, or certain properties described on the
      card itself. You can long press on any card to examine it.
