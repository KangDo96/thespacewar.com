Commander choice is an Enum.
Commanders are stored in the player state.
Commanders need to be in the matchStore state as well.
    Add to clientState->serverState mapper

Frank Johnson
 - conditional in rule service

Keve Bakins
 - conditional in MoveStationCard.js

Nicia Satu
 - conditional in NextPhaseController method: enterDrawPhaseForPlayer

The Miller
 - Break out logic for DrawCardController method: onDiscardOpponentTopTwoCards  to class "Mill"
    That class will have methods "millCount" and "canMill"
    - Use this class in the front end PermissionStore "canMill"
 - Conditional in new Mill class for method "canMill"

General Jackson
 - Conditional in canIssueOverwork.js (make sure front end provides all details)

Dr. Stein
 - For recycle cards ability: Add conditional to CanThePlayer method: "recycleCards"

 - For Perfect Plan ability:
    - Add new method to match.js that issues two requirements. A damage station card requirement followed by a Perfect Plan requirement.
    - New button on location of "Overwork" button. Should say "Perfect plan". Should issue command to method on match.js.
    - Reason "perfectPlan" where is change needed?

Beginning of game:
    1. Select who starts the game
    2. You can recycle cards, place down station cards and select 1 commander.
        The commanders are visible in the center of the screen, all 6.
        When you select a command a green border is shown around it as well as a text below that says "Selected".
        When you hover over a commander it shows a slight green border around it as well as it enlarges. Like Perfect plan overlay, but more discrete.
    3. When you're done constructing your station and one of you presses "start", you can no longer change selection of Commander.
        (that is when mode is "gameOn" the commander selection box disappears)
        The choice of command is sent with the start command?
