Integrations tests:
    These are tests that instantiate everything below Match.js. They simulate the real thing as much as possible.
    They are however still very fast, but somewhat cumbersome to write as you have to know alot to set them up correctly.

    Tend to follow these guidelines:
    - Use setupIntegrationTest for new integration tests
    - Use StateAsserter (firstPlayerAsserter, secondPlayerAsserter) instead of asserts on stateChanged directly.
    - Move away from Bocha, use Jest features when possible.
    - Sinon is okay however, they have better matchers than Jest.
